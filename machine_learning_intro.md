## What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following strict rules, ML systems identify patterns in data and improve their performance over time as they receive more information.

## Types of ML
There are three main types of machine learning:
- **Supervised Learning**: Models learn from labeled data, where each input has a corresponding correct output (e.g., predicting house prices based on features like size and location).
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Models find hidden patterns in unlabeled data without predefined answers (e.g., customer segmentation).
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Models learn through trial and error by receiving rewards or penalties for their actions (e.g., training AI to play games).

## Common Uses
Machine learning powers many everyday applications: email spam filters, recommendation systems (Netflix, Spotify), image recognition (face ID), virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa), fraud detection in banking, medical diagnosis, language translation, and self-driving cars. As data grows, ML continues to transform industries by automating complex tasks and providing valuable insights from vast amounts of information.
